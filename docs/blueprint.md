## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark desaturated blue-grey (#212936), to follow the color cues of the example images provided, which are mostly monochrome in a dark scheme. This conveys the desired modern look.
- Primary color: Bright orange (#FFA500), as a high-contrast complement to the desaturated background color. Also conveys some of the look of the image provided.
- Accent color: Muted lavender (#B284BE), as a quieter analog to the bright orange primary. The light color helps to further highlight text.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look. Suitable for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Rounded corners for all buttons and text areas.
- Soft shadows for a modern, soft look.
- Use simple, line-based icons for Bluetooth and other functionalities. To convey the 'lovable' interface style requested, consider designing the icons with rounded ends and slightly thicker lines.
- A subtle loading animation can be shown while waiting for the glove to connect.
